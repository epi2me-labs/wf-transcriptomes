<!---Example of input directory structure, delete and edit as appropriate per workflow.--->
This workflow accepts FASTQ files as input.

The FASTQ input parameters for this workflow accept one of three cases: (i) the path to a single FASTQ file; (ii) the path to a top-level directory containing FASTQ files; (iii) the path to a directory containing one level of sub-directories which in turn contain FASTQ files. In the first and second cases (i and ii), a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case (iii), the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`. If you are using the workflow for differential expression analysis the last case(iii) will be expected with a minimum of 4 samples (at least 2 replicates of each sample to compare) but we recommend 6 samples (three replicates).
