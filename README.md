# wf-isoforms

This repository contains a [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) workflow
for assembly and annotation of transcripts from Oxford Nanopore cDNA or direct RNA reads.
It has been adapted from two existing Snakemake pipelines:
* https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-nanopore-ref-isoforms
* https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-nanopore-denovo-isoforms

## Introduction

This workflow identifies RNA isoforms using either cDNA or direct RNA (dRNA) 
Oxford Nanopore reads.

### Preprocesing
cDNA reads are initially preprocessed by [pychopper](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/pychopper) 
for the identification of full-length reads, as well as trimming and orientation correction (This step is omitted for 
 direct RNA reads).

### Reference-aided approach
* Full length reads are mapped to a supplied reference genome using [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)
* Transcripts are assembled by [stringtie](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie) 
in long read mode (with or without a guide reference annotation) to generate the GFF annotation.
* The annotation generated by the pipeline is compared to the reference annotation. 
using [gffcompare](http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/gffcompare.shtml)

### de novo-based approach (experimental!)
* Sequence clusters are generated using [isONclust2](https://github.com/nanoporetech/isONclust2)
  * If a reference genome is supplied, cluster quality metrics are determined by comparing    
  with clusters generated from a minimap2 alignment.
* A consensus sequence for each cluster is generated using [spoa](https://github.com/rvaser/spoa)
* Three rounds of polishing using racon and minimap2 to give a final polished CDS for each gene.
* Full-length reads are then mapped to these polished CDS.
* Transcripts are assembled by stringtie as for the reference-based approach.
* __Note__: This approach is currently not supported with direct RNA reads.

### Workflow inputs
- Directory containing cDNA/direct RNA reads. Or a directory containing subdirectories each with reads from different samples
  (in fastq/fastq.gz format)
- Reference genome in fasta format (required for reference-based assembly).
- Optional reference annotation in GFF2/3 format.## Quickstart

The workflow uses [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage compute and 
software resources, as such nextflow will need to be installed before attempting
to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop),
[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) or
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to provide isolation of
the required software. Each method is automated out-of-the-box provided
either docker, singularity or conda is installed.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository in order to run the workflow.

**Workflow options**

To obtain the workflow, having installed `nextflow`, users can run:

```
nextflow run epi2me-labs/wf-isoforms --help
```

to see the options for the workflow.



**Example execution of a workflow for reference-based transcript assembly**

This example uses a synthetic SIRV dataset, so we need to tell minimap2 about the non-canonical splice junctions with 
--minimap2_opts '-uf --splice-flank=no'
```
OUTPUT=~/output;
nextflow run wf-isoforms/ --fastq test_data/fastq  --ref_genome test_data/SIRV_150601a.fasta --ref_annotation test_data/SIRV_isofroms.gtf
--minimap2_opts '-uf --splice-flank=no' --out_dir outdir -w workspace_dir -profile conda -resume
```

```
# To evaluate the workflow on a larger Drosophila dataset
./evaluation/run_evaluation_dmel.sh outdir
```

**Example workflow for denovo transcript assembly**
```
OUTPUT=~/output
nextflow run . --fastq test_data/fastq --denovo --ref_genome test_data/SIRV_150601a.fasta  -profile local --out_dir ${OUTPUT} -w ${OUTPUT}/workspace \
--sample sample_id -resume
```
A full list of options can be seen in nextflow_schema.json. Below are some commonly used ones.

- Threshold for including isoforms into interactive table `transcript_table_cov_thresh = 50`
- Run the denovo pipeline `denovo = true` (default false)
- To run the workflow with direct RNA reads `--direct_rna` (skips the pychopper step).


Pychopper and minimap2 can take options via `minimap2_opts` and `pychopper_opts`, for example:


- When using the SIRV synthetic test data  
  - `minimap2_opts = '-uf --splice-flank=no'`
- pychopper needs to know which cDNA synthesis kit used
  - SQK-PCS109: use `pychopper_opts = '-k PCS109'` (default)
  - SQK-PCS110: use `pychopper_opts = '-k PCS110'`
- pychopper can use one of two available backends for identifying primers in the raw reads
  - nhmmscan `pychopper opts = '-m phmm'` 
  - edlib `pychopper opts = '-m edlib'`

__Note__: edlib is set by default in the config as it's quite a lot faster. However it may be less sensitive than nhmmscan.
